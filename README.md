# Personal Preface

To preface the materials from the original README, this project was from a Data Visualization focusing on utilizing the D3.js library to make visualizations.  For the final project, we made a basic HTML/CSS website telling a basic story through data about Carbon Emissions in the United States.  We chose this topic for the abundance of data it provided.  You can see a list of my contributions below under the "How we handled the work" section.

# How we handled the work: 
Using the data we had, we determined the focus of what needed to be done.  Manu worked on Visualization 1, Trip on Visualization 2, and John on Visualization 3.  John worked on the HTML, CSS, and written story materials for the website.

We all worked on the report together, splitting it into three sections. Slides were made by everyone and presented by everyone. 

Audio for video was recored by Trip and John, and Manu edited the video together
